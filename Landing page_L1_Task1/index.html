                <p>"Education has two aspects; the first is related to external and worldly education, which is nothing
                    but acquiring bookish knowledge. In the modern world, we find many well-versed and highly qualified
                    in this aspect. The second aspect known as Educare, is related to human values. The word Educare
                    means to bring out that which is within. Human Values are latent in every human being; one cannot
                    acquire them from outside. They have to be elicited from within. Educare means to bring out human
                    values. To 'bring out' means to translate them into act provide proper css for this.</p>
